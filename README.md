# ReadBuddy

ReadBuddy is a macOS SwiftUI app designed to help kids gain confidence in reading English.  
It lets children tap on any word or sentence to hear it spoken aloud, mark “tricky” words for practice,  
and track progress over time — all locally, with no accounts or internet required.

## Features
- Tappable words with instant text-to-speech playback.
- Sentence-level playback for smoother comprehension.
- Mark tricky words and view them in a sidebar.
- Local persistence of tricky words per story.
- Accessibility-friendly large text support.

## Tech Stack
- Swift 5.9+ with SwiftUI (macOS 13+ target).
- AVFoundation for speech synthesis.
- Local JSON persistence (no cloud storage).
- GitHub Actions for CI builds.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
